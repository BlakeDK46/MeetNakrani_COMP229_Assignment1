            Science. Digital One refers to "One card to use everywhere". The main purpose of the project was to design a
            digital card that could be used to handle a variety of transactions that happen in a college student's daily
            life. Initially, we, as a group, decided to limit the usage to incorporate only to campus uses.</p>
